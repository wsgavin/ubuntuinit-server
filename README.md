# Ubuntu Server Initialization

## Purpose

I am often creating Ubuntu virtual machines for development purposes. This project is a way for me to initialize these environments after the base install. These scripts are customized for me but could be customized for anyone else's need. Nothing fancy here. **N.B.** Caveat Emptor.

## Usage

## TODO

- setup modules e.g. python, node, etc.
- setup a update option.
